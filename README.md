#burger app 

Burger is a restarant app that lets the user input the burger they would like to be made.
 
 the functionality is whenever the user submits a burger name the app should desplay on the burger on the left side of the page. the created burger should have devour button. when de burger is eaten the button is pressed the will move to the right side of the screen 
  
  was not able to complete the asignment. would finish by finishing creating server routs for posting and deleting the created burger unsing sequalize manipulate the and create database.
